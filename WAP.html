            <p>Web application architecture involves the structural arrangement of components that constitute a web application. 
                This arrangement determines how various hardware and software elements collaborate to deliver the intended features
                 and services to users over the internet. A sound web application architecture ensures scalability, security, reliability, 
                 and ease of maintenance.

        <div id="csArch">
        <h2> Client-Server Architecture:</h2>
        
        <p>This forms the fundamental basis for most web applications. It entails clients, usually web browsers, 
            sending requests to servers. The servers process these requests, execute necessary actions, 
        and return responses to the clients.
        </p>

       <div id="siArch">
        <h2> Single-Tier Architecture:</h2>
        
        <p class="info"> This basic structure integrates an application's presentation, business logic,
             and data access layers into a single unit. However, it falls short in managing 
             complex applications due to issues in scalability and maintainability.
        </p>
       </div>

       <div id="twoArch">
        <h2>Two-Tier Architecture: </h2>

        <p class="info">
            Often referred to as the "client-server" model, this architecture splits the application
             into two layers: the client (presentation layer) and the server (housing business logic 
             and data storage). This separation enhances modularity and scalability.    
        </p>
       </div>

       <div id="threeArch">
        <h2> Three-Tier Architecture: </h2>

        <p class="info">
            Building on the two-tier model, this approach segments the application into three layers: 
            presentation, application/business logic, and data storage. This facilitates better organization and independent
             evolution of each layer.    
        </p>

       <div id="microArch">
        <h2> Microservices Architecture:</h2>

        <p class="info">
            This strategy divides an application into discrete, loosely coupled services, each catering to specific
             business functions. Communication among these services occurs through APIs, enabling independent development, 
             deployment, and scaling.    
        </p>
       </div>

       <div id="monoArch">
        <h2> Monolithic Architecture: </h2>

        <p class="info">
            In contrast to microservices, a monolithic architecture involves a singular codebase containing
             all application components. It's simpler to develop but can become unwieldy as the application grows.
